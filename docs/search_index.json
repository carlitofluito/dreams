Carlito Fluito 2020-04-01 Preamble Words come to our minds. Sometimes from a mess of thoughts and images that we struggle to process; sometimes from a void of unconscious mysteries that we barely comprehend. Automatic writing is an attempt of downloading this ethereal information in unprejudiced way. The goal is increasing one’s mind understanding. Some of my most-liked text were written in pseudo-trance, half-intentional ways. Readers seem to be keen of these VIP accesses to my psychological reality. Entry badges that allow the exploration of places where I might have never been, and I may never return. Radical honesty in its purest form. Enjoy the journey and understand as much as you can. Intuitively, C. F. Figure .: Good morning! :-) If you don’t know me… If this is the first time you find out about me, I am Carlos Alcala a.k.a. Carlito Fluito.

March, 2020: It took me a while to take this picture with my Fairphone and an improvised tripod. I like the result, though.

["corona-times-in-berlin-2020-04.html", "1.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-04", " 1.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-04 1.1.1 Time for humankind performance under COVID-19 rules (2020-04-01) It is 07:07. Still synchronized with the universe. 15 minutes start running, start counting. This is why, I made a routine with timings instead of with specific hours, because I work with my own tempos. I woke up at 6 something, and then I tried to do the Wudu La Cabra, but in the whole body instead of only in the head. Basically, to take a Wim Hof shower. However, I ended up pouring cold water over my body to notice a bit afterwards that I was having a muscle contraction on my neck. So, I change plans and I took a 20 minutes warm water shower. I was already with the soap on my body, so it is was merely about using the water as a therapeutic strategy. How to relax my back, how to stretch my neck, how to avoid the contraction to become stiffer. Then, I did my morning drink: tea, salt, and lemon, and it took longer than expected. But I didn’t care, I was already in the mood of taking my time. Respecting the order of the routine, and the rules of phone fasting and food fasting, but with my own timing. Now, I am writing, which is what I am supposed to do, and surprisingly, I still remember my last dream because I could make meaning out of it pretty fast. It is al quite COVID-19 pandemic related. So, I was in a big arena, with lots of people4 There was a sort of contest/festival where different groups of people had to show their dances to the jury. The seats were crowded, and the first team started to perform, to dance. Then, the audience (the other groups) liked a lot the first performance and start joining them, most of the people start to party on the center of the arena, leaving their seats on the stands in a happy mood, and then all the people dancing altogether. A bit later, when everyone was everywhere, the judges said that they couldn’t judge because they didn’t know which one was from the performing team and which one was not. It was true. The party was cool and nice, but it was inefficient for the judges. So, the rule was to put us far, far away from the center of the arena, and separated and create distance from each other. In this way, we could dance and enjoy ourselves, without disrupting the performance of the group that was its turn, and without making big noises and agglomerations on the stands. However, the place where me and some members of my team were allocated was in the top of stadium, in a place where it was impossible to see anything and enjoy the ongoing show. It felt as if we were discriminated. It felt weird, as if we had been reclused there, claiming on the god functioning of the festival, but they were just taking us away politely because we couldn’t control ourselves, and we couldn’t make things work properly. Some of the people, me being one of the first, had the idea of coming closer little by little (I am a rebel ADHD maverick by nature.) Respecting the security distance and in small groups of spare individuals, we came down the stands, closer to the center of the arena. However, once we got closer and we could see the performance, I still wanted to come closer. We were seated separated from each other, and on our seat without moving much, like showing to the judges, who were becaming aware that we were there, that now we had learnt how to behave, and that we would keep the security distance and the silent party at our place. However, I was seeker for more. In my conscious, non-dreamy life, I am a performer. So, I was in the dream. I wanted to observe closely and analyze the movements of the dancers, not just partying. Thus, I decided to go closer, although the judges weren’t very happy again. I didn’t care much because I was being safe: distance with other people and not entering the show of the other team. I wanted to dance, and I was dancing on my spot, really repressing the willing of going to the middle of the arena and join the group that was performing. A bit later, my group and me, started preparing our own performance, which was coming later, after a couple of other groups. We kind of set up some group dynamics that everybody agreed. It was something like, at the beginning of our show all of us clapping at the same time; then stepping our feet synchronically; and then closing with the movement and pose at the end. That was it. Everybody agreed and was happy and cool with the idea and what we were going to do. Once my group was done with the preparation, I came back to see the other groups performances. However, after a while, when I came back because our moment of going to the stage was coming, I find a guy that is leading my group. He looks nice, big, energetic, and highly motivated. He is not a bad leader or anything like that. It seems that he just came up with a song that joined our three exercises, the claps, the steps, and the closing. However, now the result, the whole performance is too short and there are some people of my group that aren’t very happy with the situation and are not following him. They look quite disengaged. When he is finished rehearsing with my group, I start talking with him. I tell him that is a good idea, but it is too short and maybe not everybody agrees with the song. He tells me that it is better than the previous, more complicated and more creative. I sort of agree but keep on pointing out the limitations and issues. After a bit of talking, I decide to take the leadership again, and I say to the spontaneous new-comer leader, that if he wants to do it creatively, we can go fully creative. But then, it is better to do things differently. So, first, I tell the people that we are going to go full-mode creation. Not everybody in my group is a dancer, or a performing artist, so I take a more directive, authoritarian role. I asked those disengaged that even if it is for the 10 minutes of the performance, they have to strive to do the best they can. The judges value more the motivation and synergy of the whole group than the quality and technique of the outcome. Then, I tell them that we can keep the song rehearsed by the newcomer leader because it is indeed a good idea to mix the three movements altogether, so he will lead that part. Then, there will be a switch. I will lead the second part, where the idea is to work with a more organic spontaneous creation dynamic. For example, I am the wind, and people are static moving their arms as if they were branches of trees, or their whole bodies, as if they were sea waves. While I am moving around dancing, doing tricks, and acrobatics, (because I know how to do it and it will increase the quality of the performance), I will be telling a story, so the whole team can follow the instructions. It is a creation, improvisation task. I asked them to trust me. I wake up somewhere in the preparation of my own performance, with the feeling that for the whole piece to be complete, there is still missing a third act. An act that is still unprepared, and that although I would like it to be a collective creation, it may need to be a directed one, something similar than before because there is no time. We have to perform in very few moments. The judges and the whole arena are waiting for us. If you cannot see the metaphor with the COVID situation, I can give you some hints. We are still working and thinking in groups. (Nations). It is probably our hunter-gathered mindset forged through hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. We work in groups; it is how we are. However, we have reached a moment in humankind, where it seems possible that everybody joins the party. That we go all dancing at the same time. However, COVID, as the judges, has appear to set up new rules, to tell us to go home, to separate from each other, It feels correct, but weird. Not only we cannot be with the people of our group, but we cannot even enjoy the performance of other groups. (We cannot be with the people we love, we cannot travel…). Then, because of our nature as human, our curious and our affiliative instincts, we try to go back to the previous situation respecting the new rules, without forcing the judges to place us away and separate again. (The coming back straight after the pandemic). In this case, it seems that the festival continues. So, the groups focus on preparing their performances, but this newcomer leader appear. (Self-proclaimed internet gurus, opportunistic politicians). His suggestion is shallow, is quick, is effective, but not everybody is engaged, and although it has good quality, it is not enough. We need something deeper, something, more meaningful and really creative, where everybody can express their individuality within a coherent group dynamic. But still we need a leader because there is no time and we have to act fast. I am a communal narcissist5, so you can guess why my unconscious psyche points out that I am that leader. A leader that with good will for all and a knowledgeable perspective(Harari? Zizek?) takes most of the control of the situation, arranges a sort of agreement of engagement with all the members, and starts organizing and moving the situation forwards really quick, really fast, but efficiently and with sound knowledge. The result is of an unknown quality because there is no time of rehearsals. The group has sort of agreed because of the situation, but we don’t know what will actually happen during the performance. Nobody can say. Our time of performing is coming, and we need to go to the center of the arena with only 2/3 of the show. I will keep on writing my ideas. I ask you to keep on reading, if you connect with me. And I ask you to trust me as a good-willing leader, if my thoughts and dreams resonate on you. We may arrive tight on time, with 2/3 of the show kind of prepared. The first third may be a condensation and a mix of the ideas that were already present, quickly designed, putted together, and directed by some sort of hypermotivated new-comer leader. The second third can be an improvisation based on trust, where some leaders6 with more perspective and knowledge about the situation can give us instructions that we have to follow sort of blindly, without none of us (not even the leaders themselves) knowing whether the thing is going to work of not. A situation where we trust their experience, and commit to perform our best for the 10 minutes of duration of the performance. And then, if everything works out, maybe, and only maybe, we can improvise the third third of the performance with a party where everyone is invited to join at the stage and, hopefully, this time the judges (Viruses and other global threats of the future) join us and let us party instead of splitting us up. Keep on dreaming and enjoy your quarantine time. 7.44 - Revision and correction – 8.53 2 hours of work already :-) Now, I can continue with the routine, and do some yoga to fix the contraction of my neck. When I am writing dreams I usually start using the past form, and end up using the present. I am not sure why. Bear with it, and stick to the tale.↩ If you stop thinking about the great figures of history (Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Moses, Caesars, philosophers, artists… We were all probably communal narcissist of some kind.↩ Where I would like to include myself.↩ "],

["corona-times-in-berlin-2020-0304.html", "2.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-03/04", " 2.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-03/04 2.1.1 Scarcity mindset, positive mirroring, and non-hypocritical veganism. (2020-03-30) 10.36 15min-power nap. Just to enter, just to learn how to go deep, and then, how to go up. How to access to that place where orthography faults don’t matter. That place where I can delve and let my brain work and my hands move. Because I don’t care, I don’t care about the one that reads, I don’t care either about the one that writes. I cannot go backward and let my fingers correct something that they wrote. I may do it later or may not. If I think this doesn’t work, if I let it be maybe, just maybe some useful information may appear on the page. It is all about surrender. Surrender and write whatever the fuck is going on. Nothing about going backward, just forwards, forwards, forwards. So, now, that you have the forwards movement, the next rule is not being able to stop. Just download the information directly into the page. And the information of today it is that it is time to routine. Routine because I want to upgrade to the next level routine because I just ordered the room and what I found was space, empty space. That is what I need. I had again to fix my own life first, to start fixing that of others. That is the problem. I hate when people become not only defensive but also attacking. One thing is trying to correct others’ faults. Pointing at them and telling them how to do it better. But something I hate it when people go straight and directly for the attack. They are looking for my inconsistencies and they are pointing them out in a way that just looks for conflict, for bringing me down, for letting me know that I am not perfect, that I am not god, that I’m also human, that I sin, that I have flaws ad that I haven’t reach everything in my life. I was asking P. yesterday in WhatsApp whether saying someone “What you see negative in me, you see it negative in yourself” is an attack or not. It is clear that a positive mirror is saying “Whatever you see good on me, you see good on yourself.” “Whatever you see good in me you have it inside yourself.” But it takes time to realize that whatever they see negative in you is negative things people have in themselves. You may not say it, but just point it out at them. That is the simplicity. People may have a scarcity mindset and that is why they may think and say that 4 bananas for one day are not enough. That is really sad. Four bananas are a lot, enough for not only one day but for one week. People are too attached to their material resources, also to the immaterial ones. They think of their thoughts and ideas as something real, something that is already being manifested in reality. Look if I have an idea and you don’t like it, you don’t need to tell me that it won’t happen. Just take it as an idea, as a potential modification and manifestation of the atoms of this universe. It is not happening now, and neither you, now I, know if that will happen. That is what you need to learn and discover. Don’t deny an idea that hasn’t happened yet because you don’t know if it will ever happen. If it will ever happen. That is the magic of ideas. They are just potentialities of this universe. So, next time you are criticizing a creative idea, make it constructive, don’t do it in a destructive denial way. Be humble. If I defend veganism, and then I eat cheese, don’t try to criticize me, because I have done it. Keep on observing yourself. I only admit critics, and I only include them in my system when those critics came from people that are more aware and conscious than I am. From people that are more knowledgeable than I am. I f I don’t eat meat or cheese, and one day I eat it, look, respect my process. If you are still thinking in dualities, in either-or, in ones and zeros, you are still in a vibration that it may hinder you the comprehension of what I do. I’m not defending omnivores, and I will never do it. I will keep on defending veganism, and I am fully aware that this is one of the most ethical ways of surviving as human beings.7 But the point here is that if you haven’t experienced my reality, don’t tell me my inconsistencies. I just point out to the moral flaws of your behavior, and my hypocrisy may be a moral flaw, but it is still a smaller one than your systematically murderous behavior each time you buy and consume food. Now you may argue that I believe that I have moral superiority. That I am claiming to be morally right, or that I am just setting up a moral hierarchy, where murder is worse than hypocrisy. Well, you are right. I am doing it. If you cannot see how murder is worse than hypocrisy, then you may be a hypocrite of your own feelings and emotions. Lying, or telling partial truths is part of human experience, of human communication. Not only human but also animal. However, murdering systematically and increasing the suffering of other livings beings is not too inherent in human realities, in human nature, in human existence. This is something you may want to interiorize in your belief system. Therefore, you better start realizing the consequences of your acts and stop watching the inconsistencies of others. Jesus was quite clear and specific (supposedly) Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Matthew 7:3 I have been attacked since ever and I will still be, and that is part of the game, part of the process. Part of self-claiming myself as a prophet, as a guru, or as a messiah. People got crucified for claiming to be God’s son, and I got crucified for defending veganism and then eat 15 grams of cheese. Well, what can I do? If it bothers you so much. Don’t buy the cheese, and I will not eat it. And if it bothers you that I eat more veggies than you, stop eating meat and you may understand me. Lesson: change your mindset. Abundance over scarcity. 10.51 Revision and correction. 11.14 Frugivore may be more ethical even.↩ "],
["affirmations.html", "3 Affirmations", " 3 Affirmations This is a copy of my affirmations that I am supposed to repeat every morning. I wrote a post on my blog where I explain my process with affirmations. I was skeptic, so then, I decided to say “Simple truths” instead. Similar concept, similar results. I guess. 1. Dailies I’m alive, I love life. I’m breathing. Breathing reminds me that being alive is a miracle. I drink water. Water gives me life. I fast. Fasting gives me strength, courage and avoids excesses of dopamine. I move and stretch. Movement and stretching segregate serotonin in my brain and makes me a great performer. Performing is my job. I workout. Workout keeps my body fit and functional. I shower with cold water. Cold water strengthen my immune system. I meditate. Meditation brings sustainable wellbeing. I don’t masturbate. Masturbation drains my energy, life force, and motivation. I eat fruit. Fruit is the way of saving my life and my planet. I am enough and I deserve more. I’m lovable, and I love human beings. I am sexually attractive. I excite women. I make them feel good about themselves and their bodies. Women enjoy my company. I’m a little bit psychopath when flirting. 2. Demons I don’t check social media. Checking social media destroys my attention, makes me feel lonely, and ruins my life and potential. 3. Achievements I write for, at least, an hour every day, 6 pages a day. Writing is my way of helping others and saving the planet. Writing is my job. I don’t procrastinate. Procrastination is fear. PROCRASTINATION IS FEAR. My mind does what it thinks I want it to. I make the familiar (bad habits, tendencies) unfamiliar and the unfamiliar (good habits and tendencies) familiar. I do what I don’t want to do, and I do it first. I take daily actions. I don’t let in criticism, but I do let in praise. I don’t over think. I just do. I finish tasks, books, projects, interactions. I am a finisher. I impact and influence people’s lives. 4. Dynamics There is hope in humankind, and this planet is going to be a wonderful place. I don’t compete, I cooperate. 5. Goals I am unstoppable. I am a communal narcissist. I’m a warrior, I’m a saviour. I’m a Swami, I am a Bodhisattva. I’m Carlito Fluito. I’m saving the planet, and I’m doing it today. "],
["routine.html", "4 Routine", " 4 Routine I have always struggled with routines. My ADHD brain fights against them, even when it is one of the things that I can get more benefit from. I always find something better and more important to do than what is schedule. I am a quite creative person, and following specific and precise repetitive patterns may not match with my body/mind/soul state at a given moment. That is why, the more freedom and openness, the best. So, my routine is about finding a balance between the rigidity and structure of repetition, and the flexibility and discovery of improvisation. This is my latest attempt of building a routine. There are few improvements. There are no hours, just activity timings. Sometimes I sleep more, sometimes less. My sleep patterns are unregulated, and sometimes I am a night owl that goes to sleep at 4am; and other days, I am waking up at 5.45 with the sunrise. I am quite unpredictable. Thus, setting up time activities instead of hours of the day give me more degrees of freedom and independence. I have set up different time lengths, so I am flexible depending on how I am feeling that day. I have set up slashes between activities, so, depending on the day and the need, I can focus more on one particular thing or another. I alternate physical and mental work. I keep the food and phone fasting as long as possible to keep my dopamine levels under control. The whole routine is from 6h45 to 8h50, depending on the length of the activities. It seems very long, but the main focus is to keep the order. So, I am basically doing body and mind trian daily in about 7 hours. Like a job schedule, but self-designed and self-regulated. I have included the breakfast, a nap, and a smartphone check at mid-morning as well. Thus, if I have an early morning and wake up at 6, at about 13, I have done tons already. On the other hand, if I have a lazy morning and wake up at 9.30, at about 16.30, I would be free to socialize. I am not counting small breaks, going to the toilet, or time of transition between activities. My main struggle is with avoiding getting distracted with the smartphone or the food, and not procrastinating with whatever the random interruption of the day. Otherwise, once I get into the workflow, I am able to work consistently for a long time. I hope these ideas help those that have been tried for some time to establish a routine without much success. Wake up: Drink water (lemon, hot, Himalaya salt) + Wudu La Cabra 10min max. &amp; Phone fasting Empty mind: Dream/automatic writing + publish it. 15-45min Reconnect body: Open yoga/mobility awakening + affirmations 45min-1h15 Spiritual practice: Muslim Wudu8 + Meditation (6 phase/activation) + Breathing exercise (fire breath/Wim Hof/hypopressive) 45-60min &amp; Food Fasting + Phone fasting Mind creativity: Writing current project (Covid19: 3 Scenarios)/ Performance envisioning notebook 1h45 (3 x 35min power nap) &amp; Phone fasting + Tea Breakfast: Frugivore exclusive (smoothie) + power nap (Optional. 20min max.) 20min + 20min max Body creativity: Original workout/Choreography/Movement training (Calisthenics, Animal flow, Acrobatics, Capoeira) 45min-1h15 &amp; Phone fasting + Tea Phone check 15 min max. Publishing: Working on previous texts 1.45(3 x 35min power nap) + Phone fasting + Tea I am not Muslim, but I think it is a good spiritual practice to feel more present, connected and grateful for being alive, and clean and fresh for the meditation.↩ "],
