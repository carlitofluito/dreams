Carlito Fluito 2020-04-29 Preamble Words come to our minds. Sometimes from a mess of thoughts and images that we struggle to process; sometimes from a void of unconscious mysteries that we barely comprehend. Automatic writing is an attempt of downloading this ethereal information in unprejudiced way. The goal is increasing one’s mind understanding. Some of my most-liked text were written in pseudo-trance, half-intentional ways. Readers seem to be keen of these VIP accesses to my psychological reality. Entry badges that allow the exploration of places where I might have never been, and I may never return. Radical honesty in its purest form. Enjoy the journey and understand as much as you can. Intuitively, C. F. Figure .: Good morning! :-) If you don’t know me… If this is the first time you find out about me, I am Carlos Alcala a.k.a. Carlito Fluito.

["corona-times-in-berlin-2020-04.html", "1.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-04", " 1.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-04 1.1.1 Time for humankind performance under COVID-19 rules (2020-04-01) It is 07:07. Still synchronized with the universe. 15 minutes start running, start counting. This is why, I made a routine with timings instead of with specific hours, because I work with my own tempos. I woke up at 6 something, and then I tried to do the Wudu La Cabra, but in the whole body instead of only in the head. Basically, to take a Wim Hof shower. However, I ended up pouring cold water over my body to notice a bit afterwards that I was having a muscle contraction on my neck. So, I change plans and I took a 20 minutes warm water shower. I was already with the soap on my body, so it is was merely about using the water as a therapeutic strategy. How to relax my back, how to stretch my neck, how to avoid the contraction to become stiffer. Then, I did my morning drink: tea, salt, and lemon, and it took longer than expected. But I didn’t care, I was already in the mood of taking my time. Respecting the order of the routine, and the rules of phone fasting and food fasting, but with my own timing. Now, I am writing, which is what I am supposed to do, and surprisingly, I still remember my last dream because I could make meaning out of it pretty fast. It is al quite COVID-19 pandemic related. So, I was in a big arena, with lots of people4 There was a sort of contest/festival where different groups of people had to show their dances to the jury. The seats were crowded, and the first team started to perform, to dance. Then, the audience (the other groups) liked a lot the first performance and start joining them, most of the people start to party on the center of the arena, leaving their seats on the stands in a happy mood, and then all the people dancing altogether. A bit later, when everyone was everywhere, the judges said that they couldn’t judge because they didn’t know which one was from the performing team and which one was not. It was true. The party was cool and nice, but it was inefficient for the judges. So, the rule was to put us far, far away from the center of the arena, and separated and create distance from each other. In this way, we could dance and enjoy ourselves, without disrupting the performance of the group that was its turn, and without making big noises and agglomerations on the stands. However, the place where me and some members of my team were allocated was in the top of stadium, in a place where it was impossible to see anything and enjoy the ongoing show. It felt as if we were discriminated. It felt weird, as if we had been reclused there, claiming on the god functioning of the festival, but they were just taking us away politely because we couldn’t control ourselves, and we couldn’t make things work properly. Some of the people, me being one of the first, had the idea of coming closer little by little (I am a rebel ADHD maverick by nature.) Respecting the security distance and in small groups of spare individuals, we came down the stands, closer to the center of the arena. However, once we got closer and we could see the performance, I still wanted to come closer. We were seated separated from each other, and on our seat without moving much, like showing to the judges, who were becaming aware that we were there, that now we had learnt how to behave, and that we would keep the security distance and the silent party at our place. However, I was seeker for more. In my conscious, non-dreamy life, I am a performer. So, I was in the dream. I wanted to observe closely and analyze the movements of the dancers, not just partying. Thus, I decided to go closer, although the judges weren’t very happy again. I didn’t care much because I was being safe: distance with other people and not entering the show of the other team. I wanted to dance, and I was dancing on my spot, really repressing the willing of going to the middle of the arena and join the group that was performing. A bit later, my group and me, started preparing our own performance, which was coming later, after a couple of other groups. We kind of set up some group dynamics that everybody agreed. It was something like, at the beginning of our show all of us clapping at the same time; then stepping our feet synchronically; and then closing with the movement and pose at the end. That was it. Everybody agreed and was happy and cool with the idea and what we were going to do. Once my group was done with the preparation, I came back to see the other groups performances. However, after a while, when I came back because our moment of going to the stage was coming, I find a guy that is leading my group. He looks nice, big, energetic, and highly motivated. He is not a bad leader or anything like that. It seems that he just came up with a song that joined our three exercises, the claps, the steps, and the closing. However, now the result, the whole performance is too short and there are some people of my group that aren’t very happy with the situation and are not following him. They look quite disengaged. When he is finished rehearsing with my group, I start talking with him. I tell him that is a good idea, but it is too short and maybe not everybody agrees with the song. He tells me that it is better than the previous, more complicated and more creative. I sort of agree but keep on pointing out the limitations and issues. After a bit of talking, I decide to take the leadership again, and I say to the spontaneous new-comer leader, that if he wants to do it creatively, we can go fully creative. But then, it is better to do things differently. So, first, I tell the people that we are going to go full-mode creation. Not everybody in my group is a dancer, or a performing artist, so I take a more directive, authoritarian role. I asked those disengaged that even if it is for the 10 minutes of the performance, they have to strive to do the best they can. The judges value more the motivation and synergy of the whole group than the quality and technique of the outcome. Then, I tell them that we can keep the song rehearsed by the newcomer leader because it is indeed a good idea to mix the three movements altogether, so he will lead that part. Then, there will be a switch. I will lead the second part, where the idea is to work with a more organic spontaneous creation dynamic. For example, I am the wind, and people are static moving their arms as if they were branches of trees, or their whole bodies, as if they were sea waves. While I am moving around dancing, doing tricks, and acrobatics, (because I know how to do it and it will increase the quality of the performance), I will be telling a story, so the whole team can follow the instructions. It is a creation, improvisation task. I asked them to trust me. I wake up somewhere in the preparation of my own performance, with the feeling that for the whole piece to be complete, there is still missing a third act. An act that is still unprepared, and that although I would like it to be a collective creation, it may need to be a directed one, something similar than before because there is no time. We have to perform in very few moments. The judges and the whole arena are waiting for us. If you cannot see the metaphor with the COVID situation, I can give you some hints. We are still working and thinking in groups. (Nations). It is probably our hunter-gathered mindset forged through hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. We work in groups; it is how we are. However, we have reached a moment in humankind, where it seems possible that everybody joins the party. That we go all dancing at the same time. However, COVID, as the judges, has appear to set up new rules, to tell us to go home, to separate from each other, It feels correct, but weird. Not only we cannot be with the people of our group, but we cannot even enjoy the performance of other groups. (We cannot be with the people we love, we cannot travel…). Then, because of our nature as human, our curious and our affiliative instincts, we try to go back to the previous situation respecting the new rules, without forcing the judges to place us away and separate again. (The coming back straight after the pandemic). In this case, it seems that the festival continues. So, the groups focus on preparing their performances, but this newcomer leader appear. (Self-proclaimed internet gurus, opportunistic politicians). His suggestion is shallow, is quick, is effective, but not everybody is engaged, and although it has good quality, it is not enough. We need something deeper, something, more meaningful and really creative, where everybody can express their individuality within a coherent group dynamic. But still we need a leader because there is no time and we have to act fast. I am a communal narcissist5, so you can guess why my unconscious psyche points out that I am that leader. A leader that with good will for all and a knowledgeable perspective(Harari? Zizek?) takes most of the control of the situation, arranges a sort of agreement of engagement with all the members, and starts organizing and moving the situation forwards really quick, really fast, but efficiently and with sound knowledge. The result is of an unknown quality because there is no time of rehearsals. The group has sort of agreed because of the situation, but we don’t know what will actually happen during the performance. Nobody can say. Our time of performing is coming, and we need to go to the center of the arena with only 2/3 of the show. I will keep on writing my ideas. I ask you to keep on reading, if you connect with me. And I ask you to trust me as a good-willing leader, if my thoughts and dreams resonate on you. We may arrive tight on time, with 2/3 of the show kind of prepared. The first third may be a condensation and a mix of the ideas that were already present, quickly designed, putted together, and directed by some sort of hypermotivated new-comer leader. The second third can be an improvisation based on trust, where some leaders6 with more perspective and knowledge about the situation can give us instructions that we have to follow sort of blindly, without none of us (not even the leaders themselves) knowing whether the thing is going to work of not. A situation where we trust their experience, and commit to perform our best for the 10 minutes of duration of the performance. And then, if everything works out, maybe, and only maybe, we can improvise the third third of the performance with a party where everyone is invited to join at the stage and, hopefully, this time the judges (Viruses and other global threats of the future) join us and let us party instead of splitting us up. Keep on dreaming and enjoy your quarantine time. 7.44 - Revision and correction – 8.53 2 hours of work already :-) Now, I can continue with the routine, and do some yoga to fix the contraction of my neck. When I am writing dreams I usually start using the past form, and end up using the present. I am not sure why. Bear with it, and stick to the tale.↩ If you stop thinking about the great figures of history (Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Moses, Caesars, philosophers, artists… We were all probably communal narcissist of some kind.↩ Where I would like to include myself.↩ "],
["corona-times-in-valladolid-spain-2020-04.html", "1.2 Corona Times in Valladolid (Spain). 2020-04", " 1.2 Corona Times in Valladolid (Spain). 2020-04 1.2.1 Presidential diarrheic advice. The need of UBI (2020-04-10) 8.40 Not all dreams are easy to understand. Not everything is so obvious, even if it looks obvious. It is my second night in Spain, the first in Valladolid. Last time I was here was January. It was Christmas. It is my family house, and somehow, now is my house as well. It has to be. Supposedly, I have to spend here, at least, the next 15 days here. I have to spend the following weeks in Spain, in Valladolid, in this house. And today, I dreamt with Pedro Sanchez, the president of Spain. I dreamt he manifested somewhere, online or offline, his willing to communicate with me, that he appreciated my advices, my comments and my insights. I was okay with that, and then, I found myself walking around the center the town, on the main square. There, I met him. He was coming back from work, from the city hall, maybe. We started talking, and I told him what I thought last night before start reading Hesse’s Steppenwolf: “I wouldn’t like to be the president of my county at all”. He is probably suffering every night that he goes to sleep, he is probably quite stressed, to see how the country is crashing, how people are dying, how difficult is to manage everything in this situation. I told him that advising politicians was okay for me, because one can give an input in the system without having the responsibility of the outcome, of the situation. Besides, it was surprising how people can assume machiavellianism in politicians. They are probably doing their best with as much knowledge as they can. If not, it wouldn’t make sense that they are actually trying to save lives. I don’t know. I wouldn’t get it then. Anyways, in the dream, we met in the main square and he mentioned that he had to go to Madrid every day. I suggested him that it could be more convenient to move closer to the train station, to have less commuting time. After a bit of chitchat about his life, with me, empathizing about his situation, I asked what he wanted from me. He mentioned that he wanted my advice, something like a What would you do in this situation? type of question. I somehow started thinking out loud while we were walking towards the train station. I don’t know why we were walking there, maybe because he was leaving, or maybe because he was accompanying me. Not sure. It was interesting that, on the way, he was stopping several times to shit on trees, and wherever he could on hidden places of the streets. It seemed that he didn’t care at all. He was dressed elegantly, with jacket and trousers. And when I was looking at his face, he had the face of one of my friends, one that is always claiming to know everything concerning politics, one that is always updated about the latest political detail, and that is quite opinionated about the world. Nevertheless, one that is commonly wrong about what he says, or at least, holds extremists, biased viewpoints, or is blind to alternative interpretations. We were walking and he kept on stopping from time to time to shit. Then, while we continue walking, some people looked at him, judgmentally, making comments, and realizing that he was the president of the country. At a given moment, I realized that instead of thinking out loud and showing Pedro Sanchez that I actually didn’t know much about anything, I opted to remained silent, talking to myself, listening to my thoughts, and trying to look smart. After a while, and just before waking up, one of the things I told him clearly was: “Universal basic income”. Today, considering that 15 minutes of automatic writing have gone already, that is the only lesson of the dream: “Universal basic income”. I will do a bit of research what does it mean that the president of a country seeks for one’s advice, and that he is with a shameless diarrhea while walking on the street. Although I didn’t watch the news yesterday, I was reading Aljazeera and Financial Times before going to sleep, and there is where I found this two articles about UBI. Those two combined with my communal narcissism and that moment of empathy with Pedro Sanchez before going to sleep probably made a good mix in my REM sleep 6 hours later. Diarrhea is, after all, another symptom of Covid-19 Enjoy your day and protect yourself. 1.2.2 Trains, frozen fridges, and loneliness (2020-04-24) 8.38 Today, I know it is pointless. The past is mixed. In my dreams, I can be on a sort of campus, maybe Salamanca, trying to go training/dancing, planning to be late, to arrive walking. But suddenly my mother appears, change my plans, and indicate to me that the train station is over there and that I can arrive faster if I take the train. We go there, but none of us know the route. She tries to figure out the route checking up the schedule and maps. I am impatient, and I see trains waiting, arriving, and leaving. I tell her that is best strategy is to improvise, to take one train, the first that comes and then go to the central station and from there figure out how to go to our destination. All trains towards the city usually go to Central Station. But Salamanca didn’t have trains. Those are the trains of Copenhagen. I have to take the F line, the purple one7. But we go up in several trains that are incorrect, people tell us to get off, and the ticket reviewer is too close, so we cannot take the correct ones. We let some of the correct ones go without us for the paralysis as well. We are both confused. And my mother is not actually my mother, it is Sh. the unfinished loved of the university, one of them. Somehow, we separate from each other, and I decide on the way to not go training, to go home. Ari, the wanna-be popular girl in the class at the university is in my place. It seems that we are flatmates. Sh. appears there as well. We are also flatmates. I asked her if she got to her destiny, and if she has plans for the evening. It is Thursday evening, and again, I don’t have anyone to go out with. Sh. starts to recriminate me that I am not explaining myself, and I told her that it could have been a good plan if I would have gone dancing and then we would have met outside after her logopedic course. We could have gone together for a drink. But she is telling me that I hadn’t asked her before, that I had make up the plan without her and that she has plans already. But she is treating me like a stupid, like trying to explain something that is very obvious, that she has explained to me many times in the past. I am very confused. She is aggressive, and I was just trying to be nice and friendly. Feels like I am in the last year of university, trying to meet and hang out with my classmates from the first years, but all of them have their stuff, their lives, their friends. Ari, my flatmate, is also without plan, she is also sort of alone. While we are discussing, I am sort of unfrozen the refrigerator. Sometimes Sh. speaks with me and I am inside the fridge, looking at her speaking from the door. Sometimes, it is her the one that is inside the fridge, like speaking from the other side, with a range of foods and cans of beer in between. It is too late for some people. It is too late for trying to fix a past that is frozen, for trying to speak with people that are gone, for trying to recover relationships that never existed, or they just existed for me. No one is going to come to explain to me what happened, why they left, what I did wrong. It doesn’t matter how far I can get; some people will never be back, even if they hear about me. Those are frozen somewhere inside me, inside this time and space, so far ago that the past is starting to mix, that those things that once formed reality are starting to melt into each other, to get frozen later in a mess of anecdotes, moments, and settings that are unrelated, very difficult to disentangle, very complicated to just merely discern and make up my mind about what is there. Very difficult even to just describe them, much less to explain the link of causes and consequences that led me to a certain outcome. I have been always alone. And sometimes it seems that the more I grow the more alone I am. But sometimes it seems, that the more I live, the better friends I find. It is contradictory. How my goals have pushed me so far away from love. How loved I felt at certain moments, when I didn’t care much about my situation, but how prevalent and pervasive have been the moments where I felt disconnected from everyone, disconnected from life. I need people so much. I just know how to improvise when I am by myself, otherwise, I often screw it up. I don’t know when to make plans, because sometimes is too early, and sometimes too late. I don’t know how to ask someone out, because deep inside, I don’t want to go out, I want to stay in, together. Somehow, no one taught me how to socialize, and somehow, I ended up living by myself, trying to figure out how I ended up here, me that I used to be an open and friendly pal. Maybe too open, maybe too friendly. Anyway, at my parent house, with the security of a family that is condemned to accept me at my worst, and with the thought in the back of my mind to put my stuff in a backpack, and just leave for good, it is easy to placate the stories of miseries. However, dreams don’t lie, and all those feelings and moments always appear catching one in their vulnerable states of consciousness, just to raise the question about whether this is what you wanted all along, or you just have learned to adapt magnificently good to an okayish situation. Seems that the only redemption left is writing. So, I do. Waiting for you at the other side of the fridge, or maybe still struggling to cross it. 1.2.3 Destructively good and escape with fruits. 2020-04-25 9.21 We were at the scouts. There were a lot of leftover fruits. Apples, mandarins, and bananas. There was also a piece of cake in the co-pilot glove box in the car. We were coming back from the camp. Going home. One of the previous scenes has been the collection of that fruit, where there has been a sort of encounter between the force of good and evil. The apparently good has never had to take everything, always wanting to share what he had and even rejecting pleasures for himself. The apparently bad was pursuing control. She wanted to be in charge of the situation, controlling how things were done and how they evolve. We had to go down several floors in the dreams. Travel to the underground. There, they good and evil characters were left before we return home. They were sort of dead or sleep. Each of them had different elements. And reading some scriptures, we could see that the apparently good had a last wish of not having all the resources once dead. Thus, someone, maybe me, took one of his resources (I think it was 6 dices, one located with a different number). Thus, the number one was given to the other character (the apparently evil). But the moment one of the dices was withrown from the self-sacrifice man, and given to the other, so she could rule on that kind of world, the man became a sort of angel of fire, like a dragon, and starts spitting flames of fire all around the underground. We escape, and go up. There, the presence of that angel of fire is still sensed. He is coming, so we need to rush. We collect all the fruit possible as soon as we can and we leave with the presence of the fire and destruction coming closer and closer. The people that are with me are Rufino, an old classmate and scout mate, and Juan, a friend from the Scouts. We arrive to the car, then we leave with the huge bags of fruits which are for sharing and giving to everyone. However, there are too many fruits for so little people. Bus somehow, it was the right things to do, since otherwise, the fruits would have been destroyed by the fire of the angel. Sincerely, I don’t know. I hope it gets some meaning in the future. Actually, the purple line is the E. The F is the yellow, the one I take when I go visit my Danish friends/family. But the purple one was the one when I used when was living in Gentofte (2015).↩ "],

(2020-03-30) 10.36 15min-power nap. Just to enter, just to learn how to go deep, and then, how to go up. How to access to that place where orthography faults don’t matter. That place where I can delve and let my brain work and my hands move. Because I don’t care, I don’t care about the one that reads, I don’t care either about the one that writes. I cannot go backward and let my fingers correct something that they wrote. I may do it later or may not. If I think this doesn’t work, if I let it be maybe, just maybe some useful information may appear on the page. It is all about surrender. Surrender and write whatever the fuck is going on. Nothing about going backward, just forwards, forwards, forwards. So, now, that you have the forwards movement, the next rule is not being able to stop. Just download the information directly into the page. And the information of today it is that it is time to routine. Routine because I want to upgrade to the next level routine because I just ordered the room and what I found was space, empty space. That is what I need. I had again to fix my own life first, to start fixing that of others. That is the problem. I hate when people become not only defensive but also attacking. One thing is trying to correct others’ faults. Pointing at them and telling them how to do it better. But something I hate it when people go straight and directly for the attack. They are looking for my inconsistencies and they are pointing them out in a way that just looks for conflict, for bringing me down, for letting me know that I am not perfect, that I am not god, that I’m also human, that I sin, that I have flaws ad that I haven’t reach everything in my life. I was asking P. yesterday in WhatsApp whether saying someone “What you see negative in me, you see it negative in yourself” is an attack or not. It is clear that a positive mirror is saying “Whatever you see good on me, you see good on yourself.” “Whatever you see good in me you have it inside yourself.” But it takes time to realize that whatever they see negative in you is negative things people have in themselves. You may not say it, but just point it out at them. That is the simplicity. People may have a scarcity mindset and that is why they may think and say that 4 bananas for one day are not enough. That is really sad. Four bananas are a lot, enough for not only one day but for one week. People are too attached to their material resources, also to the immaterial ones. They think of their thoughts and ideas as something real, something that is already being manifested in reality. Look if I have an idea and you don’t like it, you don’t need to tell me that it won’t happen. Just take it as an idea, as a potential modification and manifestation of the atoms of this universe. It is not happening now, and neither you, now I, know if that will happen. That is what you need to learn and discover. Don’t deny an idea that hasn’t happened yet because you don’t know if it will ever happen. If it will ever happen. That is the magic of ideas. They are just potentialities of this universe. So, next time you are criticizing a creative idea, make it constructive, don’t do it in a destructive denial way. Be humble. If I defend veganism, and then I eat cheese, don’t try to criticize me, because I have done it. Keep on observing yourself. I only admit critics, and I only include them in my system when those critics came from people that are more aware and conscious than I am. From people that are more knowledgeable than I am. I f I don’t eat meat or cheese, and one day I eat it, look, respect my process. If you are still thinking in dualities, in either-or, in ones and zeros, you are still in a vibration that it may hinder you the comprehension of what I do. I’m not defending omnivores, and I will never do it. I will keep on defending veganism, and I am fully aware that this is one of the most ethical ways of surviving as human beings.8 But the point here is that if you haven’t experienced my reality, don’t tell me my inconsistencies. I just point out to the moral flaws of your behavior, and my hypocrisy may be a moral flaw, but it is still a smaller one than your systematically murderous behavior each time you buy and consume food. Now you may argue that I believe that I have moral superiority. That I am claiming to be morally right, or that I am just setting up a moral hierarchy, where murder is worse than hypocrisy. Well, you are right. I am doing it. If you cannot see how murder is worse than hypocrisy, then you may be a hypocrite of your own feelings and emotions. Lying, or telling partial truths is part of human experience, of human communication. Not only human but also animal. However, murdering systematically and increasing the suffering of other livings beings is not too inherent in human realities, in human nature, in human existence. This is something you may want to interiorize in your belief system. Therefore, you better start realizing the consequences of your acts and stop watching the inconsistencies of others. Jesus was quite clear and specific (supposedly) Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Matthew 7:3 I have been attacked since ever and I will still be, and that is part of the game, part of the process. Part of self-claiming myself as a prophet, as a guru, or as a messiah. People got crucified for claiming to be God’s son, and I got crucified for defending veganism and then eat 15 grams of cheese. Well, what can I do? If it bothers you so much. Don’t buy the cheese, and I will not eat it. And if it bothers you that I eat more veggies than you, stop eating meat and you may understand me. Lesson: change your mindset. Abundance over scarcity. 10.51 Revision and correction. 11.14 2.1.2 Observe with perspective. Worries disappear when you zoom out. (2020-04-08) Tegel Airport, Berlin, Germany – COVID times.9 Many people may call me irresponsible, but I think that the most punishable act right now is to be so close of taking a plane considering the environmental situation of the planet. Psilocybin heals. It heals so much that it could have been difficult to believe my calm and tranquility concerning my own death or the death of the whole humankind. I don’t know. Today I was reading about octopus and the fact that their phylogenetic line with squid and cuttlefish separated around 370 million years ago. Not bad at all. We, humans, have been around 300.000 years as species, and our civilization dates from 12.000 years. Sometimes I find ridiculous the whole existential angst that we have developed out of our realization of being temporarily alive. Octopus only live 2 to 3 years; we live from 50 to 80 depending on how lucky you are when you are born. Many times, it is all about luck. I guess I lack empathy, and I have an excess of transcendental perspective. It is undeniable that we have done a huge mess over this planet. That we have asphalted forest and place concrete over everything we could. We have built massive structures to show ourselves how tall our Babel Towers could get. And still, we are just apes. F*cking talking monkeys, nothing else. Life is so compelling, that a bird just entered the terminal and the dozens of people waiting for the plane couldn’t avoid looking at the chirping animal, flying around, probably confused about the place that just entered, wondering where are the trees, the leaves, the grains, the branches, the green. Before taking the psilocybin, I couldn’t fully understand David Cain’s comments like: Observe your surroundings and imagine how everything would have been like millions of years ago. or Observe your surroundings and appreciate how pretty much anything of what you see would change if you would disappear right now from the earth. It is tough to acknowledge and appreciate these truths when you are a teenager, fighting for consolidating your identity. But it is a sing of maturity to appreciate the level of irrelevance that we all carry in our existence. We are nothing. We are nothing as individuals, and we are nothing as species. We are just another manifestation of life in this planet, in this universe. And with the passing of the years, all our marks, even those with the deepest scars and impact in the planet, like radioactive waste, all of them will be gone. That’s it. Nothing more. And I am incredibly tranquil writing this. I am incredibly chill. Like If I knew that these levels of truths, no matter how discomforting can be for some people are utterly undeniable. We have become too attach to life. We have grown distant from death. We are children, maybe teenagers, striving to have a consolidate identity as species, that is why it is so difficult for us to acknowledge that nothing of what we are doing, or what we will ever do is inherently irrelevant. None of my words justify immoral behavior. None of my words justify the increasing of pain and suffering in living beings of this universe. Never get me wrong. Suffering and pain are something that living beings avoid and reject. Therefore, no matter how irrelevant we are, that is no excuse to cause harm or suffering in other forms of consciousness. In a similar way, none of my words justify despair or suicide. None of my words justify the act of willingly finish our own consciousness. No matter how irrelevant any of our actions is, our current form of consciousness is a gift that should be enjoyed and experience to the utmost (respecting the no-harm/no-suffering moral of before as much as possible). I am aware this is not high philosophy. Likely, if you have never subjectively experience what I am talking about you may be unable to embody and comprehend its meaning. Nevertheless, I try. I have the hope that some of my words can make people wake up a bit and realize their role in this whole game called life and the universe. We may just be a simulation running somewhere in a quantum computer of some sort. And that is okay. It doesn’t mean we cannot enjoy our current existence, and it doesn’t mean we should decrease the enjoyment of other existences. I guess that the smaller we feel about ourselves, the more we need to prove and validate who we are and what we do, and the more we need to find relevance and importance in our own actions. On the other hand, the bigger we feel and experience our consciousness, the more we can appreciate our role in the whole life performance. Individually, we are just tiny atoms in the whole history of the universe. The whole human species is just a drop in the ocean of life and evolution in planet earth. Let the waves wave and let the tides tide. Let the atoms merge and dissolve, let them structure and matter change. Let us try to maintain our existence, but let’s not get attached to it either. Let’s appreciate each of the moments of consciousness we have been gifted with and make the worries about non-existent realities disappear. Enjoy the journey, because there is nothing else than the journey. The whole universe will freeze out at some point, and existence has no more meaning than the one you create out of love in your own individual life. Love life and meaning will appear by its own. 2.1.3 Man-made life vs. Universe-made life (2020-04-09) 14.40 Bus from Madrid to Valladolid (Spain) First day of pseudo quarantine. Yesterday, I was in Berlin, in Paris, and in Madrid. Three European capitals. All empty, from airport to airport. Actually, Berlin looks pretty normal; Paris was empty from the airplane; and Madrid empty from the streets. I am afraid of sneezing too loud. I am still with my thinking and my feelings of enjoyment and pleasure. Everything is empty, the planet is breathing. It is taking a break from humans. It is common sense for me. Maybe the next pandemic will not be so tolerant with us. Actually, we are the pandemic. Covid is just the antidote. It is the balance. Today, I did nothing. The friend that hosted me for one night in a tiny guest’s room at his place told me not to touch anything, not to go out, not to do much. I understand his concerns. I obeyed. Hydroalcoholic solution at the door and sleeping all morning because there was not much to do. I almost meditate but I used the smartphone in the morning. Too much dopamine. That was the mistake, as always. At my family house, my brother can manage my smartphone, so I can use more the mornings; and the days; and the nights. Smartphones are sucking people’s lives, and this is one of those clear situations. What can I say about the pandemic? Politics and discussions. Funerary cars, and the police not allowing people to travel to their homes because they already have an alternative. The mountain looks beautiful. Psilocybin still works. It is like being high for life. That is wonderful. Once every six months. All this post-apocalyptic panorama seems to me a very wonderful scenery. No humans. Animals taking over. I don’t think I am a psychopath; I just prefer to empathize with the weakest, with the most vulnerable. In this case, it is nature and not human. I dreamt with Zambia. I dreamt I was there already. Creating, working with kids, in a big industrial unit. I am traveling to save money; to have enough to carry on with my plan; to buy a land and say “Ciao ciao” to all this game called society. I realized I don’t want to play anymore to these rules. They are not for me. And that is okay. Although it seems that it is not either for most of us. Robots will end up taking over. And that is not life as we know it. It is a different type of life. A man-made life. But man-made life has consisted in destroying universe-made life. It is weird. It put us in perspective. How much we have changed all this. Frugivore may be more ethical even.↩ If you like to see my face and hear me talking, click here.↩ "],
["corona-times-in-valladolid-2020-04.html", "2.2 Corona Times in Valladolid. 2020-04", " 2.2 Corona Times in Valladolid. 2020-04 2.2.1 Grandad’s old war tales - Batallitas de abuelo Cebolleta. (2020-04-12) 06.40 Kids and machines will make us highly irrelevant. It is this simple. There is no other way around. I used to think I was young, but my right knee aches when I sleep in cold small places, like cars or floors. Tonight, I was sleeping on the carpet of the living room of my family house, and I couldn’t breathe properly. Maybe the dust of the carpet; maybe my respiratory system. In any case, ailments of old age. Kids in the upcoming years will prove themselves infinitely more prepared and skilled than us, adults. What we can do will be of little use. Maybe teach them how we used to do things years ago; maybe just remember them that things used to be different in the past. After all, who of us likes to hear grandpa’s old war tales? We are in a historical moment where, being 27, anecdotes from my childhood may seem a First World War tale to 7 years old. Imagine being born today, in 2020. Seven years ago, 2013 (my third year of university in Barcelona) look to me just around the corner. But for a newborn kid like me, 7 years before my birth (1992) used to be 198510. Falling into topics, this is what 1985 seems to me today: Figure 1.1: I just recognized The A-Team, and I was doubting about former Spanish president Felipe Gonzalez. Tonight, I was dreaming that kids were teaching me a lesson about how to do things, how to use devices, how to live in an environment that my brain hasn’t had time to adapt to. I likely felt similar to how my grandma feels when I explained her for the fourth time how to send a voice note on WhatsApp. On the other hand, my grandparents from my father’s side cannot care less about technology. They wonder when they see my face on a screen and respond to what I say, no matter whether it is a video record or a video call. However, we awe together when we see my second niece, their great-granddaughter, using the smartphone as if it was second nature. Between great-granddaughter and great-grandparents, there are about 80 years of difference. Between my second niece and me, just 20. One fourth. This means I am getting older 4 times faster. Using my extremely faulty math, the difference between my grandparents and me is about 60 years. In just 15 years, one fourth, when I become 42, I will feel as outdated towards my second niece, as my grandparents feel with me now. I can choose to be a wannabe updated “WhatsApp grandma” spamming the family with videos that no one will watch, or just accept the speed of development. I may try to speak to a device’s microphone that is not anymore in the palm of my hand when it is actually a network already merged with my brain and working through my thoughts. I may be wrong, I may not. I guess I have read too much Tim Urban. But the question is worthwhile: What does it feel like to stand here? Figure 1.2: If you read Wait but Why, it shouldn’t be difficult to follow my train of thought. If you don’t, you should. Start here. Enjoy your day and live in the present. 2.2.2 Karmic cleansing (2020-04-17) 10.51 How do you see it, my friend? How do you see it? Do you think that you can already start with your room, or not yet? Do you think that there is a gallery and Alejandro’s storehouse that are still to be done? Can you leave the kitchen perfect and before starting with and then everything will flow? This is a karmic cleansing, which dad is not being grateful for, and he keeps thinking that I am making it selfishly, although I may do it selfishly as altruism is selfish, but it benefits everyone. David, the same. He stays in his short-term, thinking on what his perception is showing now and not realizing what it can become in just a few hours or days. They keep on focusing on the negative, in the chaos they perceive, instead of on the order that they could perceive if they look at the bathrooms, or if they look at the wardrobes of the gallery, or kitchen. They don’t realize that the clothes are done. They don’t realize that the food has been cooked all these days. Mother is able to see it a little more, but not completely. Anyways, what do you dream of? Do you dream of the idea of sleeping in the bed, like C.? Do you dream of the idea of cleaning up yourself? That is the problem. You have to give the phone to your mother at night, you have to find ways to block your problems, you know what they are. You know that it makes your life you don’t want, and you don’t deserve. You just need to isolate away from what you know is bad for you. But at least, you have healed from the loneliness, from your friends. You know your friends and you know your plan and you know that your friends will join you when your plan starts to materialize. You have seen it already. You know it is not difficult and you know you have a strategy, a system. You know what to do to reach there. You will go to Bali I for a little bit to get to know some famous guys, There, where you are already in the game, you know you are in this game where you are cleaning and ordering your house an that is what you have. No problem. This is your moment. Now, this is your place, this is what you have to do. Probably you have to switch your identity. You have to become a new person, and you don’t have a lot of time to do it. You are moving fast, and fast you to switch your identity. You need to develop and sustain routines. Saol told you, and he knew it perfectly that is your next step to become serious with your mission and with what you can do now. You don’t lose your chill anymore, at least yesterday you were able to show Cillo your limits and your limits are Don’t threaten my life. Don’t shout. Don’t lie. Don’t deny reality. Don’t call me selfish or egoist. I will be extremely clear about that. Clear and concise. He cannot say “Don’t touch my balls” as a limit because I will go through it. I am not A. and I am not a manipulative and destructive monster that just wants to destroy people. I want to make them grow and they are the ones that are suffering because of their stubbornness. It is not my problem. If they would let them be guided, they may discover how easy is to make everything going and moving, but they have a lot of barriers. Dad has a lot of barriers, but little by little they are being overcome. Well, hopefully, it will be gone soon Let’s see how it develops. For the moment, just keep on going. Maybe focus on your room, on yourself for a bit today. Organize Alejandro’s room and then move forwards and forward. That’s what I have to do. To keep on moving, Probably we’ll reach a moment when they will tell me “Thank you” and that they want to do it with me, but until that moment arrives it will be a bit of an uphill battle. You heard the lock of the door of the bath now that Cillo went inside. They don’t realize, but that is lack of trust and shyness, or whatever the name. They are ashamed of their own bodies and that’s a big problem, a problem that takes longer, and that little by little we are overcoming. I am not ashamed of my body and that is what allows me to be happier, to be able to move naked around, to fart, to burp naturally, to eat like a pig. Because maybe I am a pig. I am not ashamed of it. I am what I am, and that is it. You can check if you feel the connection with something of what I write and then move forward, what can I say? I have worked for being in front of a computer for years. I have tons and tons of paper, or written words, that if I would like to write it down it would take me a lot. That is the next level, when I have a single objective and I am finishing things one by one, thanks to my routine, when I spend days and days working because I love my work, I love what I do, I love wiring and I love stretching and training day after day. That is my moment and my situation, to prepare my body, and to move forward with my writing. I want to show my evolution to the world, I want to prove that it is possible, that I have done that right now. “I am still stuck” means, I have progressed, I am moved forwards enough to be able to write and publish. That’s it. I generate too much, and for this moment, this is fine. It is already 15 minutes. 2.2.3 Money mindset (2020-04-26) 09.40 Today I am going to make money. Not because I need it, but because I can. Also, because I need it. This is a win-win relationship with the world. If I am happy, people around me are happy. If I build my goals, and I reach the places where I want to be, everyone will be winning. I will be raising the vibration of the planet, and that is meaningful, that is important. Spirituality is speed and deep psychology. Yesterday, in a brief, meditation/activation, I said goodbye to my previous sources of money, I said goodbye to my promoter, V., who gave me a scholarship of 2.000€ per month for doing a Ph.D. that I didn’t finish; and I said goodbye to R., my landlord, who saved me from spending that money in the rent of my flat. Now, I am at my parents’ house, after two months of not receiving my salary, and after having spent part of my savings on the rent in Berlin. I am ready to work hard again. I have several books to read, several videos and websites to prepare and do, and several clients to catch. Money is out there, clients are out there, and I am the one that has to find them. I am intelligent enough to go not only for those that have some money but for those that have high amounts of money as well. I am ready to have high-paying clients, and I am going to find them. And they are going to find me. There is no problem or contradiction if at the same time I am making free, high-quality content for free to all those that cannot afford my sessions or my courses. I don’t need this or that. I have myself and I am going to do it. It is just a step by step process. I am on it, I am with it. And that’s it. I am flexible enough to not force myself to write during the whole morning, to not break the momentum and motivation with writing 30 minutes. Sometimes just half a page is enough to be clear on what I am going to do. Enjoy your day. 2.2.4 Tolerating lack of faith (2020-04-28) Paradoxes of tolerance. 23.2311 Hope my words resonate with you. If you need a map to understand me, here it is: If you are intolerant with other people, you first have to learn how to be tolerant with yourself. You can do this by practicing your acceptance. Once there, when you are tolerant of yourself and you have accepted who you are at this given moment, you can develop tolerance and acceptance for others. You can do this practicing compassion.12 Once there, when you are tolerant, acceptant, and compassionate with yourself and with others at this given moment, you can develop intolerance towards yourself. You can do this by practicing…13 I have to tolerate more; at the same time, I tolerate less. I have to tolerate less negative emotions within myself. But I have to tolerate more negative emotions within others. I used to be unable to tolerate people. I used to be unable to tolerate negative emotions in others, specially when they were transmitting me those lower vibrations. Because I couldn’t tolerate these negative emotions in myself, I couldn’t tolerate them (emotions) on them (people) either. That is why I couldn’t tolerate them (people) altogether. I have always been a quite intolerant person with other people. I couldn’t stand incompetence, I couldn’t stand mediocrity, I couldn’t stand how people were doing things so wrong that I could do so right. It was because they were generating negative emotions and feelings within myself. Same as when I was trying to explain something to someone and they were not understanding me. Those negative emotions on myself were what I wasn’t able to tolerate, and that is what made me unable to tolerate them (people). My lack of tolerance to people was a projection of those negative feelings on myself. Nowadays, that phase is gone. I have recently gone through the stage of not caring about what others do. Of telling myself things like “Fine, if they want to try something, they can. If they are doing something, good for them. I know I can do it better.” However, maybe deep inside, I was still a bit frustrated with their mediocrity. Sometimes, I even told myself that I was happy when I was seeing others succeeding. Even though, I still knew that what they were doing, I could do it, and I could do it better. However, today, after this tolerating lesson, things are different. “We are not the best version of ourselves that we can imagine. We are the worst versions of ourselves that we can tolerate.” A mixed quote of two wonderful souls, Regan Hillyer and Alyse Parker. I, Carlito Fluito, which is a soul developed out of paradoxes, am simultaneously arriving and leaving at a new stage, a new interpretation of what tolerance and intolerance mean. I have always been intolerant. Wrongly intolerant. Wrongly intolerant with myself, which is indeed, wrongly tolerant with myself. Bear with me. I didn’t tolerate myself. I was unsatisfied, it was never enough, I wanted to be above the rest. But at the same time, I was tolerating too many of my mistakes, and I was tolerating too much of my current situation. Also, I have always been intolerant with others. I was being highly intolerant with those that hadn’t reach my levels of intolerance towards themselves. Because I didn’t want to be a mediocre person, my levels of intolerance pushed myself further and further. So, I grew. But my intolerance couldn’t tolerate the levels of tolerance that others have towards themselves. I couldn’t tolerate that others were so tolerant of themselves, and that is what made me so intolerant of them. We are a reflection of what we see outside. There is no division between the inner world and the outer world. The intolerance I saw in others was the intolerance of myself. The intolerance I had towards others’ tolerance was my intolerance towards my own tolerance.14 I couldn’t stand people that were mediocre because I couldn’t stand my own mediocrity. I got frustrated and impatient when people don’t understand what I say and do, because I got frustrated and impatient when I don’t understand what people say and do. Once, I started to be more flexible with other people’s beliefs and practices. Once, I started to be more tolerant with what those above me did and said, that I was not fully understanding of; I was becoming more tolerant with what those below me did and said, which I didn’t fully understand, although I had been at their place not long ago. It is my lack of memory, and my lack of perspective what limits my views. Now, it is not frustrating, when people argue with me, or doubt about me. I don’t have to care about that, I don’t have to spend my energy on their doubts, I have to focus that energy on myself. Focus all the intolerance that I was sending to them, to myself, untill the moment that their doubts disappear, not because now they believe, but because now, they can see. They can see how my intolerance to my own being has materialized in all the things that once I said that I was going to get. I cannot tolerate anymore this version of myself that is intolerant. I cannot tolerate my intolerance to others. And this is the paradox: that through the intolerance, I can become tolerant. It is all about directions: inwards, outwards, inwards, outwards. At some point of the spiritual path, tolerance to the self appears again and reminds us that we have to be compassionate and acceptant, that we have to acknowledge who we are at a given moment, and we have to accept what people are at a given moment. We have to become more tolerant with ourselves and more tolerant of others. But at another point of this spiritual path, we move beyond and stop being tolerant with ourselves, to keep on growing and move even further, further beyond. About these places where I am heading, I cannot talk about, because I haven’t been there. Those places where I am heading are unknown to me. That is therefore the gift of ignorance, the infinite things yet to be discovered.15 Lots of love and tolerance to you all. Carlito Fluito Thanks to Wait But Why for the inspiration.↩ This is a night reflection actually.↩ Warning note: I just went peeing and realized that all this is an oversimplification, since my lovely psychopath made me grow by 1) tolerating things in myself, while 2) not tolerating certain things in others. Thus, one learns how to protect their own energy and stablish healthy limits with other people. But those are topics and nuances for another text.↩ This text is sparked by Regan Hillyer’s “How what you tolerate creates your reality”\" and Alyse Parker’s “We are not the highest version of ourselves which we can imagine. We are the lowest version of ourselves which we can accept. If you want to achieve your dreams you must turn them into irrefutable standards.”. Since I like to complicate things, I wrote my own realization.↩ You may want to re-read the quote above.↩ This is my humble humbleness, that needs so much strenghtening. Another upcoming paradox… ↩ "],
["affirmations.html", "3 Affirmations", " 3 Affirmations This is a copy of my affirmations that I am supposed to repeat every morning. I wrote a post on my blog where I explain my process with affirmations. I was skeptic, so then, I decided to say “Simple truths” instead. Similar concept, similar results. I guess. 1. Dailies I’m alive, I love life. I’m breathing. Breathing reminds me that being alive is a miracle. I drink water. Water gives me life. I fast. Fasting gives me strength, courage and avoids excesses of dopamine. I move and stretch. Movement and stretching segregate serotonin in my brain and makes me a great performer. Performing is my job. I workout. Workout keeps my body fit and functional. I shower with cold water. Cold water strengthen my immune system. I meditate. Meditation brings sustainable wellbeing. I don’t masturbate. Masturbation drains my energy, life force, and motivation. I eat fruit. Fruit is the way of saving my life and the planet. I am enough and I deserve more. I’m lovable, and I love human beings. I am sexually attractive. I excite women. I make them feel good about themselves and their bodies. Women enjoy my company. I’m a little bit psychopath when flirting. 2. Demons I don’t check social media. Checking social media destroys my attention, makes me feel lonely, and ruins my life and potential. 3. Achievements I write for, at least, an hour every day, 6 pages a day. Writing is my way of helping others and saving the planet. Writing is my job. I don’t procrastinate. Procrastination is fear. PROCRASTINATION IS FEAR. My mind does what it thinks I want it to. I make the familiar (bad habits, tendencies) unfamiliar and the unfamiliar (good habits and tendencies) familiar. I do what I don’t want to do, and I do it first. I take daily actions. I don’t let in criticism, but I do let in praise. I don’t over think. I just do. I finish tasks, books, projects, interactions. I am a finisher. I impact and influence people’s lives. 4. Dynamics There is hope in humankind, and this planet is going to be a wonderful place. I don’t compete, I cooperate. 5. Goals I am unstoppable. I am a communal narcissist. I’m a warrior, I’m a saviour. I’m a Swami, I am a Bodhisattva. I’m Carlito Fluito. I’m saving the planet, and I’m doing it today. "],
["routine.html", "4 Routine", " 4 Routine I have always struggled with routines. My ADHD brain fights against them, even when it is one of the things that I can get more benefit from. I always find something better and more important to do than what is schedule. I am a quite creative person, and following specific and precise repetitive patterns may not match with my body/mind/soul state at a given moment. That is why, the more freedom and openness, the best. So, my routine is about finding a balance between the rigidity and structure of repetition, and the flexibility and discovery of improvisation. "],
["morning-routine.html", "4.1 Morning routine", " 4.1 Morning routine This is my latest attempt of building a routine. There are few improvements. There are no hours, just activity timings. Sometimes I sleep more, sometimes less. My sleep patterns are unregulated, and sometimes I am a night owl that goes to sleep at 4am; and other days, I am waking up at 5.45 with the sunrise. I am quite unpredictable. Thus, setting up time activities instead of hours of the day give me more degrees of freedom and independence. I have set up different time lengths, so I am flexible depending on how I am feeling that day. I have set up slashes between activities, so, depending on the day and the need, I can focus more on one particular thing or another. I alternate physical and mental work. I keep the food and phone fasting as long as possible to keep my dopamine levels under control. The whole routine is from 6h45 to 8h50, depending on the length of the activities. It seems very long, but the main focus is to keep the order. So, I am basically doing body and mind trian daily in about 7 hours. Like a job schedule, but self-designed and self-regulated. I have included the breakfast, a nap, and a smartphone check at mid-morning as well. Thus, if I have an early morning and wake up at 6, at about 13, I have done tons already. On the other hand, if I have a lazy morning and wake up at 9.30, at about 16.30, I would be free to socialize. I am not counting small breaks, going to the toilet, or time of transition between activities. My main struggle is with avoiding getting distracted with the smartphone or the food, and not procrastinating with whatever the random interruption of the day. Otherwise, once I get into the workflow, I am able to work consistently for a long time. I hope these ideas help those that have been tried for some time to establish a routine without much success. Wake up: Drink water (lemon, hot, Himalaya salt) + Wudu La Cabra 10min max. &amp; Phone fasting Empty mind: Dream/automatic writing + publish it. 30-45min Reconnect body: Open yoga/mobility awakening + affirmations 45min-1h15 Spiritual practice: Muslim Wudu16 + Meditation (6 phase/activation) + Breathing exercise (fire breath/Wim Hof/hypopressive) 45-60min &amp; Food Fasting + Phone fasting Mind creativity: Writing current project (Covid19: 3 Scenarios)/ Performance envisioning notebook 1h45 (3 x 35min power nap) &amp; Phone fasting + Tea Breakfast: Frugivore exclusive (smoothie) + power nap (Optional. 20min max.) 20min + 20min max Body creativity: Original workout/Choreography/Movement training (Calisthenics, Animal flow, Acrobatics, Capoeira) 45min-1h15 &amp; Phone fasting + Tea Phone check 15 min max.

["evening-routine.html", "4.2 Evening routine", " 4.2 Evening routine Lately, I been motivated enough to give a try to an evening routine. It has been working so far, because it basically means to write few things in a paper. Hopefully, in the future can include other practices that close the daily circle in a more fruitful way. I am mostly inspired by Marcus Aurelius’ Nighttime routine, that I found on this video, and the 5 minutes journal from the journaling strategies of Tim Ferriss. I try to find strength and motivation to jot down, at least some words, even when I don’t feel like it. Let’s see how far can I get. Top three goals: In a small notebook, I write down the top three goals for the next day and I review whether I accomplish the top three that I set to myself in the previous day. It is just a short to do list to keep me humble and not becoming overconfident and too ambitious leading to frustration. Just write down the top three priorities that you sincerely think that can finish tomorrow. Five minutes journal: Just as bullets I write down: 3 things I am grateful for, they can be more general of my life, or more specific about the day; 3 affirmations that remind me that I am making progress, I am alive, or I am growing as a person; 3 amazing things of the day, I try to pick a different 3 than the gratitude ones; 3 improvements, things that I didn’t do as well as I had planned and expected, so, I will be primed to try to correct them next day; naming good things, paying attention to the things that I performed correctly and developed as I had planned or expected. According to the video the Marco Aurelius’ routine is built in several exercises. I am trying to include some exercises, while others are already inside the previous journaling strategy: Contemplation of the sage: Asking yourself, What would your ideal person do in a given situation?. It helps defining what you want in life and who you need to be for that to happen, filling the gap between who you are and the person that you need to be. It help keeping the motivation up A view from above: Observe yourself in the room, and then keep on zooming out and up, seeing your street, city, country, planet. It helps gaining perspective. You can imagine that you are a video game character that is controlled by external forces, so you can make yourself choose the right action. Physical exercise. I am two minded about this. I have read in different places that is best not to exercise at night in order to wind down and have a good sleep. But on the other hand, I am a night person with hyperactivity, so my body is super energetic throughout the day, and at on the evening I feel an extra boost of alertness. Thus, I think I am going to experiment with this for some time, doing 8 minutes abs or something similar. Mediation. I keep fluctuation with my mediation practice. In the best of cases, I meditate once in the morning and later in the evening. However, there are still days where I skip meditation. Stoics and Seneca has also a Contemplation on death, where acknowledging the certainty of your ephemeral existence (memento mori) and aiming for a “good death”, focusing on improving things under your control. I feel tempted to try the exercise on the near future. Reviewing the day. This complements with the journaling. Reviewing the different actions and situations of the day and congratulate for what went well and identify the problems. In this way you can track progress and choose what goals you want to focus on. Journaling. Write down thoughts and situation about the day that you consider worthwhile keeping. I use the Five minutes journal technique described above. So, to sum up, for the moment I would feel satisfied if I do some journaling, physical exercise or stretching (yin yoga), and a meditation session. I have found that some exercises are too motivating for the night, like the Contemplation of the death or sage, and I find more logical to do them on the early evening, when my motivation to work drops. I will keep on experimenting and updating the post. "],
