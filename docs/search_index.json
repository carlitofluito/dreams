Carlito Fluito 2020-03-31 Preamble Words come to our minds. Sometimes from a mess of thoughts and images that we struggle to process; sometimes from a void of unconscious mysteries that we barely comprehend. Automatic writing is an attempt of downloading this ethereal information in unprejudiced way. The goal is increasing one’s mind understanding. Some of my most-liked text were written in pseudo-trance, half-intentional ways. Readers seem to be keen of these VIP accesses to my psychological reality. Entry badges that allow the exploration of places where I might have never been, and I may never return. Radical honesty in its purest form. Enjoy the journey and understand as much as you can. Intuitively, C. F. Figure .: Good morning! :-) "],
["bonus.html", "Bonus", " Bonus As an extra, I have added my Morning affirmations and Routine, in case it serves as an inspiration for anyone. At the moment, I am very happy to interact with my readers. I will write in the future more specifically and clearly my practices. Nowadays, they may be a bit difficult to understand if it is the first time you read something from me. I suggest you take a look to my guides with Life advice, the one for Thriving with COVID-19, or the one for Ph.D. Students1. Therefore, if you have any comments, or questions about what is written, feel free of email me or contact me, though my website form. Best of lives!!! Life advice is very similar than the one referred above. I suggest reading the other one if you are not a Ph.D. student.↩ "],

["corona-times-in-berlin-2020-0304.html", "2.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-03/04", " 2.1 Corona Times in Berlin.2020-03/04 2.1.1 Scarcity mindset, positive mirroring, and non-hypocritical veganism. (2020-03-30) 10.36 15min-power nap. Just to enter, just to learn how to go deep, and then, how to go up. How to access to that place where orthography faults don’t matter. That place where I can delve and let my brain work and my hands move. Because I don’t care, I don’t care about the one that reads, I don’t care either about the one that writes. I cannot go backward and let my fingers correct something that they wrote. I may do it later or may not. If I think this doesn’t work, if I let it be maybe, just maybe some useful information may appear on the page. It is all about surrender. Surrender and write whatever the fuck is going on. Nothing about going backward, just forwards, forwards, forwards. So, now, that you have the forwards movement, the next rule is not being able to stop. Just download the information directly into the page. And the information of today it is that it is time to routine. Routine because I want to upgrade to the next level routine because I just ordered the room and what I found was space, empty space. That is what I need. I had again to fix my own life first, to start fixing that of others. That is the problem. I hate when people become not only defensive but also attacking. One thing is trying to correct others’ faults. Pointing at them and telling them how to do it better. But something I hate it when people go straight and directly for the attack. They are looking for my inconsistencies and they are pointing them out in a way that just looks for conflict, for bringing me down, for letting me know that I am not perfect, that I am not god, that I’m also human, that I sin, that I have flaws ad that I haven’t reach everything in my life. I was asking P. yesterday in WhatsApp whether saying someone “What you see negative in me, you see it negative in yourself” is an attack or not. It is clear that a positive mirror is saying “Whatever you see good on me, you see good on yourself.” “Whatever you see good in me you have it inside yourself.” But it takes time to realize that whatever they see negative in you is negative things people have in themselves. You may not say it, but just point it out at them. That is the simplicity. People may have a scarcity mindset and that is why they may think and say that 4 bananas for one day are not enough. That is really sad. Four bananas are a lot, enough for not only one day but for one week. People are too attached to their material resources, also to the immaterial ones. They think of their thoughts and ideas as something real, something that is already being manifested in reality. Look if I have an idea and you don’t like it, you don’t need to tell me that it won’t happen. Just take it as an idea, as a potential modification and manifestation of the atoms of this universe. It is not happening now, and neither you, now I, know if that will happen. That is what you need to learn and discover. Don’t deny an idea that hasn’t happened yet because you don’t know if it will ever happen. If it will ever happen. That is the magic of ideas. They are just potentialities of this universe. So, next time you are criticizing a creative idea, make it constructive, don’t do it in a destructive denial way. Be humble. If I defend veganism, and then I eat cheese, don’t try to criticize me, because I have done it. Keep on observing yourself. I only admit critics, and I only include them in my system when those critics came from people that are more aware and conscious than I am. From people that are more knowledgeable than I am. I f I don’t eat meat or cheese, and one day I eat it, look, respect my process. If you are still thinking in dualities, in either-or, in ones and zeros, you are still in a vibration that it may hinder you the comprehension of what I do. I’m not defending omnivores, and I will never do it. I will keep on defending veganism, and I am fully aware that this is one of the most ethical ways of surviving as human beings.2 But the point here is that if you haven’t experienced my reality, don’t tell me my inconsistencies. I just point out to the moral flaws of your behavior, and my hypocrisy may be a moral flaw, but it is still a smaller one than your systematically murderous behavior each time you buy and consume food. Now you may argue that I believe that I have moral superiority. That I am claiming to be morally right, or that I am just setting up a moral hierarchy, where murder is worse than hypocrisy. Well, you are right. I am doing it. If you cannot see how murder is worse than hypocrisy, then you may be a hypocrite of your own feelings and emotions. Lying, or telling partial truths is part of human experience, of human communication. Not only human but also animal. However, murdering systematically and increasing the suffering of other livings beings is not too inherent in human realities, in human nature, in human existence. This is something you may want to interiorize in your belief system. Therefore, you better start realizing the consequences of your acts and stop watching the inconsistencies of others. Jesus was quite clear and specific (supposedly) Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Matthew 7:3 I have been attacked since ever and I will still be, and that is part of the game, part of the process. Part of self-claiming myself as a prophet, as a guru, or as a messiah. People got crucified for claiming to be God’s son, and I got crucified for defending veganism and then eat 15 grams of cheese. Well, what can I do? If it bothers you so much. Don’t buy the cheese, and I will not eat it. And if it bothers you that I eat more veggies than you, stop eating meat and you may understand me. Lesson: change your mindset. Abundance over scarcity. 10.51 Revision and correction. 11.14 Frugivore may be more ethical even.↩ "],
["affirmations.html", "3 Affirmations", " 3 Affirmations This is a copy of my affirmations that I am supposed to repeat every morning. I wrote a post on my blog where I explain my process with affirmations. I was skeptic, so then, I decided to say “Simple truths” instead. Similar concept, similar results. I guess. 1. Dailies I’m alive, I love life. I’m breathing. Breathing reminds me that being alive is a miracle. I drink water. Water gives me life. I fast. Fasting gives me strength, courage and avoids excesses of dopamine. I move and stretch. Movement and stretching segregate serotonin in my brain and makes me a great performer. Performing is my job. I workout. Workout keeps my body fit and functional. I shower with cold water. Cold water strengthen my immune system. I meditate. Meditation brings sustainable wellbeing. I don’t masturbate. Masturbation drains my energy, life force, and motivation. I eat fruit. Fruit is the way of saving my life and my planet. I am enough and I deserve more. I’m lovable, and I love human beings. I am sexually attractive. I excite women. I make them feel good about themselves and their bodies. Women enjoy my company. I’m a little bit psychopath when flirting. 2. Demons I don’t check social media. Checking social media destroys my attention, makes me feel lonely, and ruins my life and potential. 3. Achievements I write for, at least, an hour every day, 6 pages a day. Writing is my way of helping others and saving the planet. Writing is my job. I don’t procrastinate. Procrastination is fear. PROCRASTINATION IS FEAR. My mind does what it thinks I want it to. I make the familiar (bad habits, tendencies) unfamiliar and the unfamiliar (good habits and tendencies) familiar. I do what I don’t want to do, and I do it first. I take daily actions. I don’t let in criticism, but I do let in praise. I don’t over think. I just do. I finish tasks, books, projects, interactions. I am a finisher. I impact and influence people’s lives. 4. Dynamics There is hope in humankind, and this planet is going to be a wonderful place. I don’t compete, I cooperate. 5. Goals I am unstoppable. I am a communal narcissist. I’m a warrior, I’m a saviour. I’m a Swami, I am a Bodhisattva. I’m Carlito Fluito. I’m saving the planet, and I’m doing it today. "],
["routine.html", "4 Routine", " 4 Routine I have always struggled with routines. My ADHD brain fights against them, even when it is one of the things that I can get more benefit from. I always find something better and more important to do than what is schedule. I am a quite creative person, and following specific and precise repetitive patterns may not match with my body/mind/soul state at a given moment. That is why, the more freedom and openness, the best. So, my routine is about finding a balance between the rigidity and structure of repetition, and the flexibility and discovery of improvisation. This is my latest attempt of building a routine. There are few improvements. There are no hours, just activity timings. Sometimes I sleep more, sometimes less. My sleep patterns are unregulated, and sometimes I am a night owl that goes to sleep at 4am; and other days, I am waking up at 5.45 with the sunrise. I am quite unpredictable. Thus, setting up time activities instead of hours of the day give me more degrees of freedom and independence. I have set up different time lengths, so I am flexible depending on how I am feeling that day. I have set up slashes between activities, so, depending on the day and the need, I can focus more on one particular thing or another. I alternate physical and mental work. I keep the food and phone fasting as long as possible to keep my dopamine levels under control. The whole routine is from 6h45 to 8h50, depending on the length of the activities. It seems very long, but the main focus is to keep the order. So, I am basically doing body and mind trian daily in about 7 hours. Like a job schedule, but self-designed and self-regulated. I have included the breakfast, a nap, and a smartphone check at mid-morning as well. Thus, if I have an early morning and wake up at 6, at about 13, I have done tons already. On the other hand, if I have a lazy morning and wake up at 9.30, at about 16.30, I would be free to socialize. I am not counting small breaks, going to the toilet, or time of transition between activities. My main struggle is with avoiding getting distracted with the smartphone or the food, and not procrastinating with whatever the random interruption of the day. Otherwise, once I get into the workflow, I am able to work consistently for a long time. I hope these ideas help those that have been tried for some time to establish a routine without much success. Wake up: Drink water (lemon, hot, Himalaya salt) + Wudu La Cabra 10min max. &amp; Phone fasting Empty mind: Dream/automatic writing + publish it. 15-45min Reconnect body: Open yoga/mobility awakening + affirmations 45min-1h15 Spiritual practice: Muslim Wudu3 + Meditation ( 6 phase/ activation) + Breathing exercise ( fire breath/Wim Hof/ hypopressive) 45-60min &amp; Food Fasting + Phone fasting Mind creativity: Writing current project (Covid)/ Performance envisioning notebook 1h45 (3 x 35min power nap) &amp; Phone fasting + Tea Breakfast: Frugivore exclusive (smoothie) + power nap (Optional. 20min max.) 20min + 20min max Body creativity: Original workout/Choreography/Movement training (Calisthenics, Animal flow, Acrobatics, Capoeira) 45min-1h15 &amp; Phone fasting + Tea Phone check 15 min max. Publishing: Working on previous texts 1.45(3 x 35min power nap) + Phone fasting + Tea I am not Muslim, but I think it is a good spiritual practice to feel more present, connected and grateful for being alive, and clean and fresh for the meditation.↩ "],
