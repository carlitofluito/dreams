# Preamble {-#preamble}

Words come to our minds. Sometimes from a mess of thoughts and images that we struggle to process; sometimes from a void of unconscious mysteries that we barely comprehend. 

Automatic writing is an attempt of downloading this ethereal information in unprejudiced way. The goal is increasing oneâ€™s mind understanding. 

Some of my most-liked text were written in pseudo-trance, half-intentional ways. Readers seem to be keen of these VIP accesses to my psychological reality. Entry badges that allow the exploration of places where I might have never been, and I may never return. Radical honesty in its purest form. 

Enjoy the journey and understand as much as you can. 

Intuitively, 

C. F.
