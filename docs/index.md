# Preamble {-#preamble}

Words come to our minds. Sometimes from a mess of thoughts and images that we struggle to process; sometimes from a void of unconscious mysteries that we barely comprehend. 

Automatic writing is an attempt of downloading this ethereal information in unprejudiced way. The goal is increasing oneâ€™s mind understanding. 

Some of my most-liked text were written in pseudo-trance, half-intentional ways. Readers seem to be keen of these VIP accesses to my psychological reality. Entry badges that allow the exploration of places where I might have never been, and I may never return. Radical honesty in its purest form. 

Enjoy the journey and understand as much as you can. 

Intuitively, 

C. F.

## Bonus {-#bonus}

As an extra, I have added my [*Morning affirmations*][affirmations] and [*Routine*][routine], in case it serves as an inspiration for anyone.

At the moment, I am very happy to interact with my readers. I will write in the future more specifically and clearly my practices. Nowadays, they may be a bit difficult to understand if it is the first time you read something from me. I suggest you take a look to [my guides](https://www.carlitofluitoideas.com/unfinished-books/) with [*Life advice*](https://carlitofluito.github.io/life_advice/), the one for [*Thriving with COVID-19*](https://carlitofluito.github.io/thrive_covid/), or the one for [*Ph.D. Students*](https://carlitofluito.github.io/phd_guide/)^[*Life advice* is very similar than the one referred above. I suggest reading the other one if you are not a Ph.D. student.]. Therefore, if you have any comments, or questions about what is written, feel free of [email me](mailto: carlitofluito@gmail.com) or contact me, though [my website form](https://www.carlitofluitoideas.com/contact/). 

Best of lives!!!
