<p>15min-power nap.</p>
<p>Just to enter, just to learn how to go deep, and then, how to go up. How to access to that place where orthography faults don’t matter. That place where I can delve and let my brain work and my hands move. Because I don’t care, I don’t care about the one that reads, I don’t care either about the one that writes.</p>
<p>I cannot go backward and let my fingers correct something that they wrote. I may do it later or may not. If I think this doesn’t work, if I let it be maybe, just maybe some useful information may appear on the page. It is all about surrender. Surrender and write whatever the fuck is going on. Nothing about going backward, just forwards, forwards, forwards.</p>
<p>So, now, that you have the forwards movement, the next rule is not being able to stop. Just download the information directly into the page. And the information of today it is that it is time to routine. Routine because I want to upgrade to the next level routine because I just ordered the room and what I found was space, empty space. That is what I need.</p>
<p>I had again to fix my own life first, to start fixing that of others. That is the problem. I hate when people become not only defensive but also attacking. One thing is trying to correct others’ faults. Pointing at them and telling them how to do it better. But something I hate it when people go straight and directly for the attack. They are looking for my inconsistencies and they are pointing them out in a way that just looks for conflict, for bringing me down, for letting me know that I am not perfect, that I am not god, that I’m also human, that I sin, that I have flaws ad that I haven’t reach everything in my life.</p>
<p>I was asking P. yesterday in WhatsApp whether saying someone “<em>What you see negative in me, you see it negative in yourself</em>” is an attack or not. It is clear that a <strong>positive mirror</strong> is saying “<em>Whatever you see good on me, you see good on yourself.</em>” “<em>Whatever you see good in me you have it inside yourself.</em>” But it takes time to realize that <strong>whatever they see negative in you is negative things people have in themselves</strong>. You may not say it, but just point it out at them. That is the simplicity.</p>
<p>People may have a scarcity mindset and that is why they may think and say that 4 bananas for one day are not enough. That is really sad. Four bananas are a lot, enough for not only one day but for one week. People are too attached to their material resources, also to the immaterial ones. They think of their thoughts and ideas as something real, something that is already being manifested in reality. Look if I have an idea and you don’t like it, you don’t need to tell me that it won’t happen. Just take it as an idea, as a potential modification and manifestation of the atoms of this universe. It is not happening now, and neither you, now I, know if that will happen. That is what you need to learn and discover. Don’t deny an idea that hasn’t happened yet because you don’t know if it will ever happen. If it will ever happen. That is the magic of ideas. They are just potentialities of this universe. So, next time you are criticizing a creative idea, make it constructive, don’t do it in a destructive denial way. Be humble.</p>
<p>If I defend veganism, and then I eat cheese, don’t try to criticize me, because I have done it. Keep on observing yourself. I only admit critics, and I only include them in my system when those critics came from people that are more aware and conscious than I am. From people that are more knowledgeable than I am. I f I don’t eat meat or cheese, and one day I eat it, look, respect my process. If you are still thinking in dualities, in either-or, in ones and zeros, you are still in a vibration that it may hinder you the comprehension of what I do. I’m not defending omnivores, and I will never do it. I will keep on defending veganism, and I am fully aware that this is one of the most ethical ways of surviving as human beings.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> But the point here is that if you haven’t experienced my reality, don’t tell me my inconsistencies.</p>
<p>I just point out to the moral flaws of your behavior, and my hypocrisy may be a moral flaw, but it is still a smaller one than your systematically murderous behavior each time you buy and consume food. Now you may argue that I believe that I have moral superiority. That I am claiming to be morally right, or that I am just setting up a moral hierarchy, where murder is worse than hypocrisy. Well, you are right. I am doing it. If you cannot see how murder is worse than hypocrisy, then you may be a hypocrite of your own feelings and emotions. Lying, or telling partial truths is part of human experience, of human communication. Not only human but also animal. However, murdering systematically and increasing the suffering of other livings beings is not too inherent in human realities, in human nature, in human existence. This is something you may want to interiorize in your belief system.</p>
<p>Therefore, you better start realizing the consequences of your acts and stop watching the inconsistencies of others.</p>
<p>Jesus was quite clear and specific (supposedly)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</p>
<p>Matthew 7:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been attacked since ever and I will still be, and that is part of the game, part of the process. Part of self-claiming myself as a prophet, as a guru, or as a messiah. People got crucified for claiming to be God’s son, and I got crucified for defending veganism and then eat 15 grams of cheese.</p>
<p>Well, what can I do? If it bothers you so much. Don’t buy the cheese, and I will not eat it. And if it bothers you that I eat more veggies than you, stop eating meat and you may understand me.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson: change your mindset. Abundance over scarcity.</strong></p>
